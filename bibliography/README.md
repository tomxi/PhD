## Forawrd
My research intuition has led me to the crossroads where **music theory**, **graph theory**, and **computational audio informatics** meet.
There would naturally be holes in my current grasp of each topics listed above, nonetheless I would like to first build a convincing narrative that showcases the tremendous potential where these topics meet.

### Current Hypothesis
From a traditional music theory perspective. 
There are many dimensions/elements of music, perhaps orthalgnal with each other (Yust, 2018).
- pitch
    - melody
    - harmony
- rythm
    - syncapation/surface rythm
    - grove/meter
- timbre
    - dynamic
    - articulation
    - and *everything* else...
- form

Each of the above elements have rich structure, and graphs are natural ways of expressing the essence of these relationship.
The fact mathematical graph theory can be successfully used to understand musical relationships has deep roots, making it's way into major branches of contemporary music theory: Neo-Riemannian theories showcase an aspect of the sturcture in the pitch space, while Schenkerian thoeries showcase the sturcture that is the form of a piece of music.

I aim to promote the individualities of each of the identified elements, and build different graphs that captures the essense of the strucutre of that individual element.
I aim to understand a musical performance as **~~walks~~ dances on graphs**, with each elements dancing individually in their own relational space that is distilled as a graph that features some relationships of interest. In other words, a piece of music is multiple independent walks on different graphs all at once. Each of these trajectories in the element space might seem trivial, but I argue that music is essentially the multimodal congrunencies/counterpoints that happens between the trajectory of each separable elements in their respective relational space.

Computationally, this could motivate a princle for build **new digitial representations** of musical pieces as **multi-walks-on-graphs**. Many contemporary **Music Informatics** techniques, including neural nets, could be meaningfully applied as soon as an appropriate digital represnetation of music can be codified as concurrent patterned trajectories on meaningful graphs, each capturing the most important relationships of a single element of music.

### Other important themes
- Duality/Multiplicity
    - Chord to Note = Note to Spectrum (French Spectralism Music)
    - Each graph have a dual graph: Note as vertices, Triades as faces = Note as faces, Triades as vertices. 
- All about the Distance
    - Tonnetz can bu put on a torus
    - The vertices of my graphs are really lattice points on a topology, which features a certain aspect of the pitch space's structure.
    - if our current 12-tone systems are lattices points on a continuous space... other tuning systems?
    - once we have a topology, we can quantatativly compare different trajectories on such a topology. These topologies, such as the tonnetz, are what I consider to be the language of a certain musical tradition.
- Equality for All elements
    - One mission of my work is to promote the indepence of each separable musical elements by study their trajectory in their respective spaces individually first before considering the guestault effect that is the multimodal coungruency/counterpoint that is made up of these individual trajectories.

### Bottom line:
A music performance is like a ribbon dance in a (high dimentional) space, and when viewed from different perspectives produces different beautiful patterns, each making sense in their own right.
The beauty of music is such that we can percieve all of these dimensions at once, with ease, and the meaning of music comes from the intereactions between these perspectives.

### Music Theory

Cohn, R. L. (2012). _Audacious euphony : chromaticism and the triad's second nature._ New York, Oxford University Press.

    This work establishes the topology of the harmony space by formalizing the concept of distance between triads. 
    Many musical examples and examples of useful graph formulations in the harmony space that is the tonnetz. 
    My foundational text in the Neo-Riemmanian tradition.

Cadwallader, A. C. and D. Gagné (2011). _Analysis of tonal music : a Schenkerian approach._ New York, Oxford University Press.

    This is my reference text on traditional Schenkerian analysis.

Yust, J. (2018). Organized time : rhythm, tonality, and form. New York, Oxford University Press.

    This text heavily influenced my understanding of music.
    A relativly new, but highly insirational text that formalizes and promotes the independence of separable elements of music.
    Extending from Neo-Riemmanian and Schenkerian traditions, this work formalizes the use of graph for multiple dimentions of music systematically.

Krumhansl, C. L. and L. L. Cuddy (2010). A theory of tonal hierarchies in music. Music perception, Springer: 51-87.

    This text talks about some relationship in the tonal space that I can leverage to build relational spaces (graphs on topologies).
    This is inline with the Position-finding Pattern-matching philosophy of understanding music, and musical spaces.

Kopp, David. "On Performing Chopin’s Barcarolle." Music Theory Online 20.4 (2014).

    This text symbolized a "lighthouse" to anchor my musical research.
    How can theory advnace performance, or otherwise translate to actional knowledge, has been a distinct interest of my since Prof. Kopp inducted me into the world of chromatisism in the Nei-Reimmanian tradition.
    His class also made me became fascinated with this perticular piece: Chopin's Bacarolle, which I've learnt and performed on piano.
    A specific musical piece, like Chopin's Barcarolle, can illuminate many concepts that I would want to develop, and this text is a model on how to use theory to concretely influence music making.
