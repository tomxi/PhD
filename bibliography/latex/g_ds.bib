  title={Introduction to probability},
  author={Bertsekas, Dimitri P and Tsitsiklis, John N},
  year={2000},
  publisher={Athena Scientinis},
  annote={Intro level textbook for probability. The book often provides cheat-sheet like summary of important facts in probability, and is therefore a good reference.}

  title={Pattern recognition and Machine Learning},
  author={Bishop, Christopher M},
  publisher={Springer},
  year={2006},
  annote={Classical text book on Machine Learning. A good reference that covers a broad range of topics, including graphical models and more. While lacking on deep learning techniques, this book is still the go-to reference for machine learning.}

  title={Hierarchical variational autoencoders for music},
  author={Roberts, Adam and Engel, Jesse and Eck, Douglas},
  year={2017},
  annote={This article is my reference for variational autoencoders (VAE). The hourglass structure of VAE means its a natural compressor, exposing different levels of resolution at different levels. This can be a relevant idea if I decide to work with hierarchical structures.}
