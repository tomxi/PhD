  pages={277--332},
  year={2007},
  publisher={Duke University Press},
  Annote={This is a succession from Ian Quinn's dissertation. The concept that musical objects occupy relational spaces are further developed here. The topology of these musical spaces are at the heart of my research interest.}

  year={2008},
  publisher={American Association for the Advancement of Science},
  annote={Setting up with five invariances, (octave shift, permutation, transposition, inversion, and cardinality change), this work explores how these new rules can influence the voice leading space and create new progressions.}

  journal={Journal of Music Theory},
  pages={1--52},
  year={2012},
  publisher={JSTOR},
  annote={the Tonnetz, being one of the oldest and most important graph/topology, has alternative constructions. By systematically exploring the potential intervals that are represented by the edges, extended tonnetz can account for non-traditional harmonies outside of the triadic language.}
