# Thursday 2/4 3-4

## Agenda:
- Registration
- Candidacy
- ISMIR Submission

## Notes:
Registration: send forms along.

Probablity: long run:
    Math MT
    David temperley's book

Similiary with Uncertainty
    one of {many chords}

ISMIR Submission idea:

    Chord estimator
    Key center estimator

    +> produce roman numeral (erros)


    Corpus study motivates useage of probablistic descriptions of musical concepts

    Example:
        Viterbi, leave out the decoding, and look at the Transition Prob matrix => a way towards a graph laplacean

    Dataset:
        Chord model's training set?
        Key model's training set?

        GuitarSet + Effects?

        1217 for Chords
        some for Key center
        MIDI synthesis is a real possiblity
        
        and Real data
        Isophonics
        Giantsteps
        AMAPS?

        AFTER MODELS are set:
        Scan Rock Corpus
        compare with Temperley.
        Closer look at Rock Corpus study.

        Need to validate the probablility calibration actually helps
    
        Comparisons:
        different strategies for doing the roman numeral converstions, and how they compair to human annotation.

        1 conparison: marginalize or maxLikelyhood
