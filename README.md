Music is dances on graphs.

## Current Major Checkpoint:
- Candidacy Fall of 2021, Topic proposal ensuit.
- *9/15* Annotated Bibliography and Research Statement.

## Current Minor Tasks:
- [ ] Organize ideas into slide decks.
- [x] *2/2* Start thinking about ISMIR
- [x] *1/28* Continue to work on bibliography.
- [x] *1/21* Produce Annotated Bibliography to find the 3-person Candidacy panel. 

## Random Thoughts:
- 2/16 Hierarchical division of time.
- 2/13 Spanning Tree over members of a set (keys), and path length is distance.
- 2/10 Rhythm Spiral, logrithmic bpm <=> pitch class.
- 1/21 Formulating wavenet in terms of graphs. I think it's leveraging the structure of the topology that is the time dimension.
