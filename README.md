## Random Thoughts:
- 2/16 Hierarchical division of time.
- 2/13 Spanning Tree over members of a set (keys), and path length is distance.
- 2/10 Rhythm Spiral, logrithmic bpm <=> pitch class.
- 2/1 spectral flux between different notes/chords on the same instrument, and see local minima.
- 1/21 Formulating wavenet in terms of graphs. I think it's leveraging the structure of the topology that is the time dimension.
